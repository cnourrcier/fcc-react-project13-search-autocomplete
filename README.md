# Search Autocomplete

Part 13 of the freeCodeCamp 25 React Project for interview. 

This is a React project which provides an autocomplete feature for searching users. It takes a URL as a prop to fetch user data. As the user types in the input field, it filters the user list based on the input query and displays suggestions in a dropdown. Upon selecting a suggestion, the input field is updated with the selected user, and the dropdown disappears.
